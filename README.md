# Flash Report Automation
---

### Objetive & Result
The goal behind the report automation was to reduce department workload by eliminating a weekly, realitvely time consuming morning process. After a few rounds of the report, an analyst could expect to  spend anywhere from 1-2 hours with regards to compilation and data validation. 
Additionally, due to the presentation requirements, there were many emails/views sent to different parties. The automation process made a majority of that communication effortless. As a result of these scripts, department resources where reclaimed and the free time allowed for a shift in focus to more productive analyses.
